Temporal relation between income and consumption in France between 1949 and 2012
=======================

Time series project in R


Using open data from the [INSEE](http://www.insee.fr/fr/) (French National Statistics Institute), this project aims at modeling and forecasting the income and the consumption of the French households, and at analyzing the relation between these two variables.
The data used has been deseasonalized, and taken between 1949 and 2012.

The first part of this project is focused on modelling and forecasting each series using ARIMA models.

The second part of this project aims at studying the relation between these two variables using VECM models.
