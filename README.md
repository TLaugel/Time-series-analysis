Time series project in R: relation between income and consumption in France



Using open data from the INSEE (French National Statistics Institude), this project aims to model and forecast the income and the consumption of the French households, and analyze the relation between these two variables.
The data used has been deseasonalized, and taken between 1949 and 2012. This project has been done at ENSAE ParisTech in 2013, in collaboration with Ilan Bourgines.

The first part of this project is focused on modelling and forecasting each series using ARIMA models.
The second part of this project aims at studying the relation between these two variables using VECM models.
